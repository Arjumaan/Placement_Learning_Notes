# Placement Training Notes & Technical Skills Development

Welcome to my comprehensive repository for placement preparation and technical skill building! This environment is designed to organize my learning journey across various domains.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to systematically document my progress in:

- **Core Programming:** Mastering languages like Python and JavaScript.
- **Cybersecurity:** Learning security concepts, tools, and best practices.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Exploring AI/ML concepts and applications.
- **Placement Preparation:** Solving coding challenges, aptitude questions, and interview preparation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by topic to keep everything focused and accessible:

### 1. **`Python_Learning/`**

- **`venv/`**: Isolated Python virtual environment for this project.
- **`*.py`**: Python scripts and exercises (e.g., `sample.py`, `lab1.py`).
- Focus: Fundamental syntax, data structures, algorithms, and libraries.

### 2. **`Cybersecurity/`** *(Coming Soon)*

- Focus: Notes on security principles, network security, ethical hacking, and related tools.

### 3. **`AI_ML/`** *(Coming Soon)*

- Focus: Machine learning concepts, AI algorithms, and project implementations.

### 4. **`Web_Development/`** *(Coming Soon)*

- Focus: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and framework-based projects.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup (Python)

Since Python requires a specific environment, follow these steps to use it:

**1. Activate the Virtual Environment:**

- **Windows (PowerShell):** `.\Python_Learning\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- **Windows (Command Prompt):** `.\Python_Learning\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

**2. Run Python Scripts:**

- Ensure the environment is active (look for `(venv)`).
- Run: `python Python_Learning/filename.py`

## 📝 Future Updates

This README will evolve as I add new modules, complete projects, and expand my knowledge base. Each section will be updated with relevant resources and innovative projects.
